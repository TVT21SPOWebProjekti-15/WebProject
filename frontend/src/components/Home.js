        <p>This web application is a tool for different climate change datasets which are visualized in charts. For
          example you can watch global temperature anomalies from 1850 onwards. In this application there are eight
          different charts, with six of them working. User visualisation view was planned but due to time limitations,
          was not implemented. Go and take a look. </p>
